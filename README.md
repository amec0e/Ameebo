#  BOTW 24H Bypass

There are 399 of each compatible nfc for `The Legend of Zelda: BOTW` to allow back to back scanning to avoid the 24 hour Same ID scan limit. These are in a zip file are they are too big for github so they are in their own zip file as there is over 9900 nfc files.

The reason they are in their own character directories is to avoid the A-Z sorting on the flipper zero being disabled when there is over 400 files in the same directory.

Usage: Extract the contents of the `BOTW_24h_Bypass.zip` and Copy the `BOTW_24h_Bypass` over to the SD card under `/ext/nfc/`
